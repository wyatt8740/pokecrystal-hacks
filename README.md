Wyatt's hacks:

* Removed password prompt for clock reset, changed key combination back to down-select-B on title screen.
* added back the Color Test debug menus. Pokemon debug menu is left-select-B, Trainer debug is right-select-B on title screen.
* Added a way for cheaters to mess with stuff in game (change 'DEBUG_MODE' in 'constants.asm' to 1)
